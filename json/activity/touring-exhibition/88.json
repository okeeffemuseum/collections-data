IN 2002, THE GEORGIA O'KEEFFE MUSEUM LOANED ONE OF ITS ICONIC flower paintings to the White House, Jimson Weed (1932, fig. 1), as one of a number of paintings selected from various museums for the President's dining room. the painting was recently returned to us and is being exhibited along with the Steuben crystal plate from our collection. The plate is engraved with the drawing of the Jimson Weed flower that Steuben commissioned from O'Keeffe as part of the project: \"27 Artists in Crystal.\" It is one of a series of special editions of crystal objects that Steuben produced in the 1930s and 1940s. Each edition, whether of bowls, glasses, or plates, was engraved with a drawing by an artist, some of which were O'Keeffe, Henri Matisse, Isamu Noguchi, and Grant Wood. On display also is a photograph of the President's dining room that includes the painting."
