Curators for the Exhibition, which was organized by the museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are Karen Haas, Gilles Mora, and Theodore E.. Stebbins, Jr. All works in it have been generously lent by the William H. Lane Collection, owner of the artist's photographic estate. \n \nCharles Sheeler (1883-1965) ranks as one of the master modernist photographers of the twentieth century, yet his work in this medium has been exhibited far less than that of his peers, such as Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand. More than any of his contemporaries, Sheeler succeeded in bringing the stylistic breakthroughs of the Cubist paintings of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso to his exciting photographs of numerous, indigenous American subjects. Artist Marius de Zayas wrote: It was Charles Sheeler who proved that Cubism exists in nature and that photography can record it.\" Sheeler was also a highly gifted painter, and his innovative integration of painting and photography foreshadowed much later modernist trends and developments in American art."
