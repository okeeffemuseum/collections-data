Using a horizontal format segmented in three parts depicting on the left a Kachina against a neutral background of biege complemented by a stand of delineated cactus-like forms. At the center, irregular and geometric cultural symbols are set against a mottled background in pink, dissolving at the left into transparent bands of light green and pink against a beige background and held visually in place by a gray-black horizontal band. The center is partitioned from both sides of he composition with a vertical band in light blue on the left and a black and white band on the right. The right portion of the composition depicts a Kachina, similar in size and posture to the figure on the left side. but now in grays and black against a vivid mottled background of red, orange and salmon colors with circular symbols at each side."
