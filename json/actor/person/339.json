            "label": "The Hood Museum of Art is a museum in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. Dating back to 1772, the museum is owned and operated by Dartmouth College. The current building, designed by Charles Willard Moore and Chad Floyd, opened in the fall of 1985. It houses both permanent collections and visiting exhibitions. The collection encompasses important holdings of American, Native American, European, African, and Melanesian art, including a significant collection of indigenous Australian contemporary art and a major archive of photojournalism. Among the collection's greatest treasures are Assyrian reliefs and the fresco mural cycle The Epic of American Civilization, by Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco. (The murals are located in nearby Baker Memorial Library.) ^The museum has paintings by Perugino and his workshop, Luca Giordano, Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Rene Jollain (Belisarius Begging for Alms), Pompeo Batoni, \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun, and Jan Davidszoon de Heem. Later European painters represented include Alfred Sisley (Loing Canal at Loing), \u00c9douard Vuillard, and Picasso. Americans with paintings here include Joseph Blackburn, Gignoux (New Hampshire), Rockwell Kent, John French Sloan (Roofs of Chelsea, New York City), and Georgia O'Keeffe.The director of the museum is John Stomberg.The museum building closed temporarily in March 2016 for a major expansion and renovation. During this time the museum's exhibitions continued at the temporary \"Hood Downtown\" exhibition space. The museum reopened on January 26, 2019. (Sourced from Wikipedia, August 2019)",
