The Protestant college was founded by evangelical abolitionists in 1860. Wheaton College was a stop on the Underground Railroad and graduated one of Illinois' first African-American college graduates. ^Wheaton is noted for its \"twin traditions of quality academics and deep faith,\" according to Time magazine and is ranked 20th among all national liberal arts colleges in the number of alumni who go on to earn PhDs. Wheaton is included in Loren Pope's influential book Colleges That Change Lives. A 2017 article in The Economist described it as one of America's foremost Christian institutions.
