            "label": "Una Hanbury (n\u00e9e Rawnsley), (1904-1990) was an American sculptor best known for her bronze portraits. ^Hanbury was born Una Rawnsley in Staines, England and grew up primarily in Kent. Her grandfather was Hardwicke Rawnsley. After graduation from London's Polytechnic School of Art, she studied for three years at the Royal Academy. Jacob Epstein was her most influential teacher. She moved to Washington D.C. in 1944 to work for the British Embassy. After taking time off for her family, Hanbury resumed her art career in the mid-1960s. She had one-person exhibitions at the Folger Shakespeare Library and National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. in 1971. In 1970 she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where she stayed until her death in 1990. Her papers are in the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. (Sourced from Wikipedia, August 2019)",
