            "label": "David Herbert Lawrence (11 September 1885 \u2013 2 March 1930) was an English writer, novelist, short story writer, poet and essayist. His modernist works reflect on modernity, social alienation and industrialization, while championing sexuality, vitality and instinct. His best-known novels\u2014Sons and Lovers, The Rainbow, Women in Love, and Lady Chatterley's Lover\u2014were the subject of censorship trials for their radical portrayals of sexuality and use of explicit language. ^ ^Lawrence's opinions and artistic preferences earned him a controversial reputation; he endured contemporary persecution and public misrepresentation of his creative work throughout his life, much of which he spent in a voluntary exile that he described as a \"savage enough pilgrimage\". At the time of his death, he had been variously scorned as tasteless, avant-garde, and a pornographer who had only garnered success for erotica; however, English novelist and critic E. M. Forster, in an obituary notice, challenged this widely held view, describing him as \"the greatest imaginative novelist of our generation\". Later, English literary critic F. R. Leavis also championed both his artistic integrity and his moral seriousness. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
