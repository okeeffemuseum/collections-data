Known for his sculpture and public artworks, Noguchi also designed stage sets for various Martha Graham productions, and several mass-produced lamps and furniture pieces, some of which are still manufactured and sold. ^ ^In 1947, Noguchi began a collaboration with the Herman Miller company, when he joined with George Nelson, Paul L\u00e1szl\u00f3 and Charles Eames to produce a catalog containing what is often considered to be the most influential body of modern furniture ever produced, including the iconic Noguchi table which remains in production today. His work lives on around the world and at the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and Garden Museum in New York City. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
