            "label": "The Toledo Museum of Art is an internationally known art museum located in the Old West End neighborhood of Toledo, Ohio, United States. It houses a collection of more than 30,000 objects. The museum was founded by Toledo glassmaker Edward Drummond Libbey in 1901, and moved to its current location, a Greek revival building designed by Edward B. Green and Harry W. Wachter, in 1912. The main building was expanded twice, in the 1920s and 1930s.  Other buildings were added in the 1990s and 2006. ^Effective July 1, 2019 John Stanley is serving as the interim director as the board conducts an international search for the 10th director.
