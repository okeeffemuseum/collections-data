Considered one of the most influential sculptors of the 20th-century and a pioneer of modernism, Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i is called the patriarch of modern sculpture. As a child, he displayed an aptitude for carving wooden farm tools. Formal studies took him first to Bucharest, then to Munich, then to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris from 1905 to 1907. His art emphasizes clean geometrical lines that balance forms inherent in his materials with the symbolic allusions of representational art. Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i sought inspiration in non-European cultures as a source of primitive exoticism, as did Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Andr\u00e9 Derain, and others. However, other influences emerge from Romanian folk art traceable through Byzantine and Dionysian traditions. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
