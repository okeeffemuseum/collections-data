            "label": "Bonwit Teller & Co. was an American luxury department store in New York City, New York, founded by Paul Bonwit in 1895 at Sixth Avenue and 18th Street, and later a chain of department stores. ^ ^In 1897, Edmund D. Teller was admitted to the partnership and the store moved to 23rd Street, east of Sixth Avenue. ^ ^Bonwit specialized in high-end women's apparel at a time when many of its competitors were diversifying their product lines, and Bonwit Teller became noted within the trade for the quality of its merchandise as well as the above-average salaries paid to both buyers and executives. ^ ^The partnership was incorporated in 1907 and the store moved to the corner of Fifth Avenue and 38th Street. ^ ^Throughout much of the 20th century, Bonwit was one of a group of upscale department stores on Fifth Avenue that catered to the \"carriage trade\".  Among its most notable peers were Lord & Taylor, and Saks Fifth Avenue. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
