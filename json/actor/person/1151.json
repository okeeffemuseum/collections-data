His son Abram Leeds took over and grew the company to be one of the largest shirt producers. Brands under the company included Henry Grethel, The Vera Companies, John Henry, Perry Ellis, Lady Manhattan and Frost Bros. ^The company incorporated in 1912. It had garment factories employing mostly women in several states. Operations included a factory complex in Paterson, New Jersey. Manhattan Shirt Company was one of the initial tenants in the Emmet Building on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. ^Larry Leeds, the president and chairman of the company in 1977, backed the creation of Perry Ellis International. Robert Lewis Leeds jr. was the CEO of Manhattan Industries through 1974, when he left to work with Victor Kiam at Remington. ^The company was acquired by Salant Corporation in 1986. ^ ^ ^== References == (Sourced from Wikipedia, August 2019)",
