            "label": "The Whitney Museum of American Art, known informally as \"The Whitney\", is an art museum currently located in the Meatpacking District and West Village neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City. The institution was orginally founded in 1930 by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1875\u20131942), a wealthy and prominent American socialite, sculptor, and art patron after whom it is named. The museum only moved to its current location in 2015. ^ ^The Whitney focuses on 20th- and 21st-century American art. Its permanent collection, spanning the late-19th century to the present, comprises more than 25,000 paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, photographs, films, videos, and artifacts of new media by more than 3,500 artists. It places particular emphasis on exhibiting the work of living artists as well as maintaining an extensive permanent collection of important pieces from the first half of the last century. The museum's Annual and Biennial exhibitions have long been a venue for younger and lesser-known artists whose work is showcased there. ^ ^From 1966 to 2014, the Whitney was at 945 Madison Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side in a building designed by Marcel Breuer and Hamilton P. Smith. The museum closed in October 2014 to relocate to its current building, which was designed by Renzo Piano at 99 Gansevoort Street and opened on May 1, 2015. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
