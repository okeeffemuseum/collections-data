The museum operates a gallery in the John N. A. Griswold House, a National Historic Landmark that is one of the first American Stick Style buildings. It was designed by the noted American architect, Richard Morris Hunt in 1864 and one was one of his first commissions in Newport. The museum purchased the house in 1915. ^ ^The museum's second gallery space was built in 1919 and was designed by Delano & Aldrich.  Dedicated to the memory of the artist Howard Gardiner Cushing, the museum added the Sarah Rives lobby and Morris Gallery to the building in 1990.The museum's school is the Coleman Center for Creative Studies at 26 Liberty Street.
