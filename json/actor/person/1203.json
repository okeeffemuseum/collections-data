            "label": "Boni & Liveright (pronounced \"BONE-eye\" and  \"LIV-right\") is an American trade book publisher established in 1917 in New York City by Albert Boni and Horace Liveright.  Over the next sixteen years the firm, which changed its name to Horace Liveright, Inc., in 1928 and then Liveright, Inc., in 1931, published over a thousand books. Before its bankruptcy in 1933 and subsequent reorganization as Liveright Publishing Corporation, Inc., it had achieved considerable notoriety for editorial acumen, brash marketing, and challenge to contemporary obscenity and censorship laws.   Their logo is of a cowled monk. ^ ^It was the first American publisher of William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Sigmund Freud, E. E. Cummings, Jean Toomer, Hart Crane, Lewis Mumford, Anita Loos, and the Modern Library series.  In addition to being the house of Theodore Dreiser and Sherwood Anderson throughout the 1920s, it notably published T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land, Isadora Duncan's My Life, Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts, Djuna Barnes's Ryder, Ezra Pound's Personae, John Reed's Ten Days That Shook the World, and Eugene O'Neill's plays.  In his biography of Horace Liveright, Firebrand, author Tom Dardis noted B&L was \"the most magnificent yet messy publishing firm this century has seen.\"  In 1974 Liveright's remaining backlist was bought by W.W. Norton. Norton revived the name as an imprint in 2012. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
