            "label": "Marie Cosindas (September 22, 1923 \u2013 May 25, 2017) was an American photographer. She was best known for her evocative still lifes and color portraits. Her use of color photography in her work distinguished her from other photographers in the 1960s and 1970s. Most of her photographs were  portraits and pictures of objects like dolls, flowers, and masks. ^ ^In 1962, Ansel Adams recommended Cosindas to Polaroid for their artist trial of their new instant-developing color film. She was the fifth woman, and only the second photographer working in color, to have a show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, in 1966. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
