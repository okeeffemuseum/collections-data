            "label": "Robert Ralph Young (February 14, 1897 \u2013 January 25, 1958) was a United States financier and industrialist. He is best known for leading the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway and New York Central Railroad during and after World War II. He was a brother-in-law of the famous western painter Georgia O'Keeffe. ^Because of his initials, R.R. Young was often labeled \"Railroad\" Young; he was otherwise known as the \"Populist of Wall Street,\" or, as his press agent encouraged journalists to call him, \"The Daring Young Man of Wall Street\". He regarded himself as a crusader against the mismanagement of railroads by banking interests. Young's most famous advertisement slogan was \"A hog can cross the country without changing trains - but you can't.\" ^Despite his vocal criticisms, at the railroads he led, Young inaugurated many forward-looking advances in technology that have ramifications to the present. He was one of the first railroad executives to introduce high-speed diesel powered passenger trains which utilized lightweight equipment. He was also involved with the first large-scale railroad computer system, as well as diversification of freight traffic and development and implementation of larger and better freight cars of all types.
