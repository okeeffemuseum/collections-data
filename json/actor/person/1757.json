            "label": "Joan Mir\u00f3 i Ferr\u00e0 ( mi-ROH, US also  mee-ROH, Catalan: [\u0292u\u02c8am mi\u02c8\u027eo j f\u0259\u02c8ra]; 20 April 1893 \u2013 25 December 1983) was a Spanish painter, sculptor and ceramicist born in Barcelona. He was known as Joan Mir\u00f3 in the art recognition. A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundaci\u00f3 Pilar i Joan Mir\u00f3, was established in his adoptive city of Palma in 1981. ^ ^Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as  Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of the childlike. His difficult-to-classify works also had a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Mir\u00f3 expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an \"assassination of painting\" in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.
