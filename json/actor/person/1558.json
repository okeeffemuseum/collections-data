            "label": "The Illinois State Museum features the life, land, people and art of the State of Illinois. The headquarters museum is located on Spring and Edwards Streets, one block southwest of the Illinois State Capitol, in Springfield. There are three satellite locations: Dickson Mounds in Lewistown, the Lockport Gallery in Lockport, and the ISM's Research and Collections Center in Springfield. ^ ^In addition to natural history exhibits, the main museum in Springfield focuses on the state's cultural and artistic heritage. Exhibits include local fossils and mining, household displays from different historic periods, dioramas of Native American life, archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, and a collection of glass paperweights. ^ ^Due to Illinois budgetary challenges, the Illinois State Museum was temporarily closed from October 2015 to June 2016. After adopting an admission fee, the flagship museum reopened on July 2, 2016.  The fee is waived for children and veterans. The Chicago Gallery and the Southern Illinois Artisans Gallery were not reopened. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
