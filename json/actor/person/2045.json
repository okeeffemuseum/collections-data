            "label": "Mitchell Armitage Wilder (August 17, 1913 - April 1, 1979) was founding director of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art in Fort Worth, Texas. When Wilder arrived in Fort Worth, in the summer of 1961, he presented the board with a visionary program that continues to be manifested in the museum's acquisitions, exhibitions, and publications. ^ ^The program Wilder articulated was shaped by his remarkable experience as a mid-twentieth century arts administrator, one who was not a graduate of Paul J. Sachs\u2019 legendary Harvard course \"Fine Arts 15a: Museum Work and Museum Problems,\" as were many of his contemporaries, directors of most major U.S. art museums. Wilder\u2019s training, after graduation from Toronto\u2019s McGill University Fine Arts Program, was to direct arts organizations undergoing dramatic transformations with remarkable founders including Alice Bemis Taylor, John Gaw Meem, John D. Rockefeller Jr., Jr., Walt Disney, and George Nelson (designer).",
