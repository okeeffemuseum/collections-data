            "label": "Montague Francis Ashley-Montagu (June 28, 1905 \u2013 November 26, 1999) \u2014 born Israel Ehrenberg \u2014 was a British-American anthropologist who popularized the study of topics such as race and gender and their relation to politics and development. He was the rapporteur, in 1950, for the UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\". ^ ^As a young man he changed his name from Ehrenberg to \"Montague Francis Ashley-Montagu\".  After relocating to the United States he used the name \"Ashley Montagu\". ^ ^Montagu, who became a naturalized American citizen in 1940, taught and lectured at Harvard, Princeton, Rutgers, the University of California, Santa Barbara, and New York University. Forced out of his Rutgers position after the McCarthy hearings, he repositioned himself as a public intellectual in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing regularly on television shows and writing for magazines and newspapers. He authored over 60 books throughout this lifetime. In 1995, the American Humanist Association named him the Humanist of the Year. (Sourced from Wikipedia May 2023)",
