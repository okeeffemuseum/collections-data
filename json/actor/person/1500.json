            "label": "The National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA), located in Washington, D.C., is \"the first museum in the world solely dedicated\" to championing women through the arts. NMWA was incorporated in 1981 by Wallace and Wilhelmina Holladay. Since opening in 1987, the museum has acquired a collection of more than 6,000 works by more than 1,000 artists, ranging from the 16th century to today. The collection includes works by Frida Kahlo, Mary Cassatt, Alma Woodsey Thomas, \u00c9lisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e-LeBrun, and Amy Sherald. NMWA also holds the only painting by Frida Kahlo in Washington, D.C. ^ ^The museum occupies an old Masonic Temple, a building listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. As of August 2021, the museum is temporarily closed as it undergoes a $66 million transformative renovation. The museum will reopen to the public on October 21, 2023.
