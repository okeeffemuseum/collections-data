I am signing and returning the lease to you. Will you sign it as witness - and ask Mr. Pederson, the superintendent if we have done it right. Not much use in having some one out here sign it - Then send it to the company for me. They have said nothing about the upstairs room so I say nothing. The dinosaur is just about 3 miles from me. I haven't been to see it yet. Think I'll go when I mail this. Country life keeps me very busy -

We are back where we belong and it is so fine to be back. The trip went very well but the work at Fisk was a real Salt Mine job in the deepest shaft.

I have your letter this morning and I am certainly surprised and sad to hear about Bert - Life is so surprising isn't it - I know you will miss him tho it was not always smooth.  I had intended to write you to tell him to stop and see me when he went across country as I assumed he would. [Illegible] passes - and we wonder to where.  I wish I could be with you a little. I think Carl Banbechler is a little active with his imagination about Doris. She is going to Fisk for a while - maybe a couple of months but I do not think she will stay.  Our stay there was so difficult on can not say. I rather think the climate will be poisonous for her.  She seems very well now - better than I have ever seen her. I am trying to push her so that she will get off in February - 
 
[Page two] 
 
I wrote your landlord about the lease. He answered that you do not need a lease - so I guess it is alright to leave it as it is. I think about the linoleum that you probably have to do that your self. What is there was there when I moved in but when I moved in over on the river at 405 E 54 - I had to tend to that myself - 
Mary Callery came for Xmas - will be here another week - It was the most [Illegible] Xmas I've had in many years - We went up on the mountain into the snow for the Xmas tree - have a green long needle one in the grey room trimmed and a tall blue spruce standing on the well in the patio not trimmed but very pure and beautiful - Maria came for a couple of days - would have stayed longer if invited I think - She went on to Old Mexico and we all

breathed more freely - Doris has been behaving very well so the house goes quietly - Except that the cars behave rather badly with the cold weather and their advancing years. The electric blanket is very fine - Keeps me very comfortable and warm.  I always thank you for getting it for me.  I am such a [Illegible] We are all very well - Scurry around in the cold but it is good. Have had very little snow. The small kitten is a demon - has had his name changed to Francis the Crab.

Dear Francis: 
 
I wonder how you are down in your shaft of the mine. Doris is leaving in the morning.  Then I will go 
into my own [illegible] shaft where I hope to find my own best salt. We have had a most wonderful winter. Each day so warm and lovely one feels it may be the last. Then it isn't-and the fine days go on-one after the other like a dream. I think you will find Doris improved - she looks very well and I think is better in her mind.  I think she hopes to stay with you till about [illegible word strike] March. I have nothing to say about that except that you do as you wish - as is most convenient for you.  She will be leaving  
 
[page two] 
 
for Fisk at that time. If you do not let her stay with you would you mind if he arranged to see two or three people at the apartment?-people she will have to see for me.  It may work out that she can see them at the Place-and it may not.  I do not know how things will be there-but I thought you would not mind her using the apartment that way for me-whether she is staying there or not. Also she has sent a box to the apartment-either in you are or mine.  We did not dare send it to the Place as there might be no one there to receive it. I hope all this will not bother you. 
 
[Page three] 
 
Have you any plans about coming out again?  The winter has been so warm that always one thinks spring will start tomorrow.  I have been so very pleased to be here. Thanks for all the Ettie etc news-I am interested to hear but I would rather be right where I am. The convent is finished. There was a high Mass for the blessing before they moved in. I went with much interest.  The Arch Bishop interests me - very much.  He makes the voice of God seem very stern. I was very interested. Then - we have had two or three [crossed out text] funerals.  A truck.  
 
[Page four] 
 
then the men of the town [illegible] head walk singing� a real kind of a cry of sorrow.  The [probably pentitentes] bell tolls - The women walk silently - double file after the men - Then after that - cars and trucks and what not follow - - The procession goes up the hill opposite me. The sad cry moving off in the distance up on the hill to the cemetery.  It is a sad wonderful sort of sound - and a sorrowing sight. I would like them to sing that way when I die. My love to you Francis - I look forward to your coming again -

As it may change your plans about being here I must tell you that if you wish to stay at the ranch you could eat over at Ghost Ranch if you wish or at least go over there for your principal meal - Also I think you can probably ride from there if you wish as they have horses.

My best greetings to you and Bryan for 52! It was kind of you to help Ellie with her problems. I hope she got home safely - Mary Callery came for Xmas and will be here till the 12th - Then Doris takes off with her by car for N .Y. I will be glad to be alone. I am making order in the studio so I'll be ready to work as soon as I am alone. I dont know why it seems so important for me to be alone but it does �

Having Mary has been pleasant - it is good to hear some of the town news tho it has little meaning to me as I live my country life. I sent you a piece of linen for making canvas if you wish. I hope it gets to you -  
We have had a little snow - some cold days and many fine warmish ones - Winter here seems to me better than summer - I hope all goes well with you

I wish you could have been here tonight to see what happened to your box of clothing. Jackie came after school - The suit didn't fit him but he took what did fit and some of the smaller things that his mother could fix for his little sister - Then tonight 5 little boys just happened in as if their intuitions and eagerness made them know the box was here - Well they had a wonderful time and so did I - The youngest was 10 -  The oldest 14 - They tried things on and looked in the mirror at themselves - They were very positive  abo about having a reasonably fair division - You would have laughed as I did and they did - It was amusing and touching at the same time - Finally some one had taken it all but the two small orange ties and the big old shoes - The second youngest picked up the big old shoes and asked if he could take them to his grandfather -  So they were gone �

My friend Edward just fitted into the suit - and as he never had a suit before except levis - he was pretty pleased with himself - wearing also the purple shirt - As you probably know Doris left Jan. 12 with Mary Callery - driving . Chino was not well from the time we returned from visiting you and died soon after they left. Maybe he wouldn't have died if l had kept him at home and nursed him myself - I was really sad about I - Emelia left me before Xmas - she had just become impossible -  I was glad to have her go - It was almost as if she had gotten a little odd in her mind - The new person I have is better in many ways - she can drive to town for our errands which is very good - We get on very well - It has been very pleasant to finally be alone - I have been able to get to work in a way that I just couldn't with Doris here - I don't know why I am that way but I am - I've been painting the bare trees and mesa out my

Francis Dear: 

Doris writes me you are ill - I had wondered about you as I hadn�t heard in so long. - Do have some one else write and tell me if you are not able - It is so long since I have seen you  - way back to the time Rose was hereand we went to the [illegible] tribal - I did not go to the Snake Dance as [illegible]- I was too tired - Peggie and her family were at the Ranch till Sept. 14 - As soon as they left I went up there and stayed till Nov. 10 - [illegible] Priest was with me there for three weeks on his way back from [illegible] where he had been with some others - collecting the big Japanese show that is [illegible] to this country - I had [illegivle] up there - she hears much less than before but she makes my life very comfortable and tho I worked all the time I was there in some odd way I had a real rest - so much so that 

[page two] 

I plan to go up there this spring and stay - I work too hard in the garden here - I enjoy it enormously but I can not do it and paint too - I wonder if you ever knew [illegible] Einstein - Years ago he was with Alfred and  me so much - you may have known him - Alfred had made him his executor if for any reason I could not sense.  He was here at the house in Abiquiu with a new wife from Sept. 1 til Dec. 1 - He urged me and helped me to collect all the Stieglitz-material that was here and send it to Yale - It was what Doris should have been working on and [illegible] out of the house, when she was here for 10 months - I had no idea she had stored away [strikeout] here what she had.  It was only her [illegible] she wanted to work on it and as I had come to the conclusion she didn�t finish things because she didn�t want [strikeout] to moveon I decided to do it myself -  

[page three] 

I can not leave these [illegible] ends of my life unfinished - I did a lot of pushing - Went through picutres I had sent [illegible] [illegible] to destroy - and 40 went up in flames. - I an die as well as the next one and I just cant leave any more than necessary for any one else to bother with - Doris [illegible] so oddly and unexpectantly ill made me [illegible] aware of it - of course - she is furious and terribly upset - but it seemed to me I had no choice - I can not have her here again for any length of time - she is jut too impossible - and I think she must move away from me and my doings if she is to survive at all - I [strikeout] have written and advised her to send me the key to my room in N.Y. - and that she should go onto any thing that is different - I did not ask for the key - I advised her to drop 

[page four] 

Everything as it is - no matter how and walk away - I do not know what will come of it but it seems to me the only thing for her to do for herself - Don�t bother to write me about it unless you have some real idea - I see it as a sickness that she had when she came to me and that she fastened on to me for her salvation - - which I am not. - Now do have some one write me what is wrong with you - My fire [strikeout] burns in the corner - there is frost on my windows - I roll my bed over near the window so I can see more with the dawn - The sun begins to creep across the valley and it is time for me to get up - Mary Callery came

For Xmas but will be gone this next week end - and I will be at work - Her being here has been good - it gets me out for a long walk every day - Yesterday we spent at the ranch - took a longwalk in the snow.

How long will you be wanting Maude  -that is - how many hours days or what - and how much do you want to pay her. I think you owe her nothing - I will tell her 2 weeks before I go - She does very well - has learned to cook a few things very well - but still has a temper once in a while - She is very clean as you know.

As you will not be returning before I go I am sending you enclosed bills - The first telephone bill came the day after you left - The other one later - I went to Washington - saw  the cherry blossoms - Then to friends north  of Baltimore - a  wonderful  farm and such a beautiful peach orchard - Day after my return Doris and I drove to New Haven to see if we want to put the Stieglitz papers in the Yale library - Probably will - Life is hard in the mines as usual - Today - Sunday - I spent all day working on my vault

Doris just came in from home with lovely flowers - magnolias and long  green branches. I am not sure how long it will take me to get to New Mexico - I hope to get there in time to have you come.

Notes - 17 June 2002 - about the photos in the "O'Keeffe" files:

The photos, about 80 of 'em, are identified as best I can recall by their file-titles, including ID of subject, photographer and place.  I tend to be pretty vague about dates -- don't hold me to the exact years on the labels; they're close but may be one or two years off here and there.
	
Abbreviations are used for names that appear frequently.  These are:
OK = Georgia O'Keeffe
FOB = Frances O'Brien
BG = y'r ob't s'v't, Brian Garfield

	One or two of the pictures brought back recollections of things I'd forgotten during previous taped conversations with various friends from the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.  I don't know if anyone else has mentioned this, for example, but O'Keeffe really enjoyed being on the roof of the Ghost Ranch house.  Sometimes she'd lie up there looking up at the sky and fall asleep on the roof and not come down till morning.  (I recall that from the late '40s and early '50s and obviously am referring to summer rather than winter months.  She wasn't a masochist.)  
	When she did come down the ladder, I recall that her first chore of the day usually was to grab a garden hoe and go around the outside of the house beating the scrub-growth for rattlesnakes.  If she found any she'd try to chop their heads off with the hoe.  Often they were too fast for her, but at least they slithered away from the house, which was her objective; only when she knew the snakes had been cleared would she let the chow-chow dogs out of the house for their morning constitutionals.  Again we're talking about the warmer months here; rattlers didn't put in appearances during the winter.  I think they hibernate.
	
	I don't know if the original O'Keeffe painting of the road below the mesa survives, so the photo herein may be the only record of it.  She later simplified it down to the "Road Past The View" picture that's familiar to us all, but the original version -- as can be seen by the juxtaposition herein of the painting with a photo of the same view -- was much more realistic and comprehensive.  "Minimalist art" can be a contradiction in terms, but in O'Keeffe's case art really did mean less, not more.  She talked in terms of "distilling" and "reducing" and "simplifying".  The objective was the essence of a thing.  She focused your attention by getting rid of extraneous matter.  Even as a child I could grasp that much.  In fact O'Keeffe, even though she complained that she didn't like children, was remarkably childlike in some ways and had no trouble communicating with kids because she tended to speak in a simple direct manner.  Her ideas were not simple but the expression of them was.  She spoke the way she painted -- with economy and grace.

	A couple of the pictures in this group of 80 or so contain portions of cars.  In one case I know the car was O'Keeffe's (it's a picture in which O'Keeffe is standing off a bit and my mother is half out of the car), but am not sure of the makes, models or owners of the others.  Am mentioning this because sharp-eyed experts can tell you the exact year and model of a car even if all they have to go on is a photograph of a bumper or a headlight.  That can help establish the date of a photo.

	A few of the pictures were taken in Tucson, where my mother and I lived from about 1950 on.  O'Keeffe came there to visit us several times, starting then and visiting for the last time in 1971 when she stayed at my mother's house while attending the University of Arizona festivities accompanying their opening of the Ansel Adams photo collection.

	As I've already discussed with y'r tape recorders, my mother and Doris Bry and O'Keeffe shared tenancy in the loft apartment at 59 East 54th Street from about 1945 to 1948 (give or take a year or two).  O'Keeffe owned it; she used it as a pied a terre when she came to New York, which she did as infrequently as possible after Stieglitz died.  Doris Bry was cataloguing the Stieglitz estate for O'Keeffe and the Beinecke collection at Yale.  My mother was painting portraits for magazine covers.  She painted virtually all the covers of "Saturday Review" Magazine for a bit more than seven consecutive years -- I think 1944-1951, give or take -- and continued to do occasional covers for them into the 1960s; she also did portraits for book jackets and other magazines, and private commissions.  I think she actually preferred doing landscapes but not being a business whiz, she couldn't make a living doing that.  

	Some of the photos in this group were taken during the construction (or, more accurately, reconstruction) of the house in Abiquiu that O'Keeffe bought (I seem to recall she'd bought it from the church -- had it been a rectory long ago?).  I hope these are a bit helpful in showing the changes, but unfortunately I can't remember exactly when the construction was going on.  I think it was right at the end of the 1940s.  I was born in 1939, so my memories are not especially precise when it comes to assigning dates to things that happened when I was at an age when calendars don't matter.

	The photos range from the mid-1940s to the early 1970s.  A few are in color but most are b&w snapshots.

	If you have questions about any of the pictures, feel free to try them on me, with the understanding that I can't promise to have sensible or adequate answers.

Alfred-it is a beautiful still clear Monday morning-I am in order to work but will say good morning to you first. I just read your last [illegible] clipping about our leadership-thank you-it sounds pretty sad.
I've been looking at my two paintings that I like. I believe they do not spoil a nice clean wall. I have a large empty bedroom with one almost white wall-when a painting doesn't spoil this bedroom it isn't bad-Last evening we drove [illegible] to the foot of the cliffs and had our supper-tho I do it so often it always is new and exciting to me. Lay on the ground by a very little cooking fire looking at the sky for a long time as the stars came-had watched the sun go over the many miles of wide country. We-that is Maria-found a fine big rattle snake in our garbage pit yesterday. From his rattles he must have been ten or twelve 

[Page 2]

years old. It was quite an exciting few moments-she called me before she killed it-
She is reading the Fenellosa aloud to me. I suppose it may seem almost funny to you that I wish to read it but it is really very interesting. Then when I got into bed I got that Bible of the World and hunted up some of the religious writings of the period we had been reading about in the Fenellosa.
It is so quiet Alfred-and I like it so much here-Still I think of you with your cold at all sorts of odd hours-I hope it is better-
A quiet little kiss to you on your forehead. I'll get at my "doings"-.

Saturday-May 1-43
[Illegible]-I am home-and it is a still-warm-hazy day-I am glad to be home-Maria having every thing in order makes this place seem really wonderful-My three years of thinking of this place as a place that I live begins to do something to it that softens its edges a little and fits it to my way-God-it is so still-with the warm air moving with a very little breeze-a bumble bee-and a few birds far away-I am out in the patio looking toward the flat topped mountain. My native weeds that I choose to have as flowers are sprouting all by them selves-The country is very dry here-I like being satisfied with what passes for weeds-

[Page 2]

Maria met me in Santa Fe as I asked her to. The car loaded all ready to go-We saw Johnnie on the street. I told him about his photographs-He was very pleased-On the way up here we stopped to see the garage man-the people in the store where we do most of our trading-the post master in Abiquiu-the native woman Maria had been staying with who has eggs-she is my oldest friend among the natives-then a new white man who will have milk and butter about 13 miles below here-By the time we got home I felt quite fitted into the community life-we had our supplies-the sun was just down. I looked about a little-changed to my country shoes-the whole house in beautiful order and cleaner than it has ever been-helped unpack the car-

[Page 3]

we had supper and went to bed-
I slept wonderfully-was up a little after six-looking about-walked around the house out doors. -looked at the cliffs and the mountains-walked out to the corall were Maria is starting a garden-came back and got into bed till I heard her stirring in the kitchen-helped get breakfast-and oh dear-was it good-cheese and chilli and garlic and lots of it-and grapefruit and coffee-It is odd the way I am here and it all seems very fine but I do not feel recovered from my sadness at leaving you-so tho this is really very fine-I do not feel quiet here-A quiet kiss to you

Maria thought your [atter] fine and sends you her love

Sunday afternoon-after six-May 2
Today I put away my things that I brought in my suitcases-My bed room is so neat and clean and orderly-I wish you could see it-Maria had put white curtains at the windows-For the present I leave them there but they will probably come down later-I think you would think it nice-I know you would-it feels very good to me-I also washed my head-I pushed a few other things around to make it feel as if I live here-The sun has been hot-not as windy as yesterday-the shadows always cool-so much so that when the sun left the patio I went and got my green shawl. This morning I lay in the sun-the sun is very good-mostly it has been a day of making order-A kiss to you-I

wonder about you so often-what you are doing-how feeling. The shadows from the setting sun are creeping up my mountain-the plains are already in shadow-I wish you could see it-a sort of solid dream floating out there-A kiss to you. I'll go up on the roof for the last light-

Monday afternoon-almost 5-I was up at 6:30-and the house neat and out to work at about 8-Down among the big cotton wood trees out in front of the house-I drove down there-it must be about 3/4 of a mile-with lifting a few old logs and breaking some bushes I got the car down into the low place by the rive- it was fine-warm and still-the sun very hot so I finally took off my underwear-I got started so that I can go on and paint I think-only drawing this morning-The ^ [inserted above line] big [/inserted above line] trees just turning the new green-it is the thing I so much have wanted to try in the early spring for years-I came in at about 1:30-terribly tired from the sun and heat but it was good-ate lunch and got into bed-I don't dare go back this afternoon but will go early tomorrow-It was a fine morning-A quiet kiss to you-

Dear Mr. Stieglitz-
I was very happy to have your letter-to know that you sit on a straight chair-and like it. Indian babies, reared on a cradle board are different from American babies. They are conceived on the earth, on a sheep skin, and all of their life they are not too far from

A native said to me the other day of Georgia's annual returning to this land: "She comes to it like

I was pleased today when she said that this year was to be a real year-that she felt more like working than she had in a very long time.

Tuesday afternoon-4:30. It has been a grey day with a very little rain-I was waked by one of those curtains flapping at my north window-When I saw that it was grey and that there was wind I turned over and stayed in bed till an hour or so after breakfast-but as we had breakfast a little after seven I wasn't too late getting up. I've been getting canvases stretched and finding what stretchers I need to get when next the car goes to town-I had it all spread out on the floor in my big room-For I feel so much like working it is wonderful-Canvases and stretchers spread like a sort of map all over the floor look fine-Arthur brought us the mail and came in out of the rain and sat talking for an hour or so-His set up seems to be fairly self sufficient-and he looks well-So that is started-

Maria is laboriously planting a garden-she certainly works hard-. I had your letter this morning about feeling very small-I almost feel that I don't exist-I looked at the Post coming out on the train-it is pretty sorry-I thought that maybe you would not send them your prints. Oh I guess many things do not matter-you alone know your own truth-I know a little of it and what I know is very precious to me-There are many who have had a glimpse of it-otherwise the Post would not attempt to swear it-I kiss you quietly-with all my love and admiration for you-Remember I always have hold of your hand-

We like them to eat-of course, you wouldn't-but I am so glad to find them growing wild-after lunch I picked them over and put them in the ice box-then lay down for almost an hour-Working out always seems more tiring than in-I haven't had the mail today-will get it when I mail this

Good afternoon Mr. Stieglitz: How are you
When I waked this morning my face was hot from wind burn-It was day light-the sun shining and as I lay there thinking about my hot face-I remembered how I have always liked that sort of [illegible deletion] warm skin feeling that comes from sun and wind. Yesterday afternoon we went to Abiquiu for eggs and other food-it was after five when we left [here]-sunny and windy-[We] went to visit my Mexican woman friend-Flora [Brunette]-had taken our supper for picnic but ate it in her kitchen by lamp light as it got late and cold before we got to the eating-Flora is tall and lean-white-haired ^ [inserted above line]dark skinned [/inserted above line] and always very neat-every thing she has and does is very neat-Her garden so neat one just stands and looks in amazement at the smooth spaces of soft newly spread earth-it is so perfect one feels it should be treasured in some way-She is perfect like old Ella but she

[Page 2]

2-is warm and beautiful-not sour and mean like Ella-She has a fine little grand son Tommy Jo-about nine-It is a nice house to go into-We drove most of the way home with the top of the car down-the stars over head so fine-but finally the cold made us put the top up-then the warmth was good. I seem to enjoy such simple things that I some times think I am just queer. This morning I was out with my trees again all morning-it is cool enough to wear a light woolen piece of underwear with my overalls-the sun in and out-a little wind-my painting seems to go pretty well-It is fine being down in a place like that where one has a feeling of spring coming on the very big old trees-

[Page 3]

The Sunday times came yesterday-Wednesday-we read it with such interest you would laugh-thank you very much-A quiet kiss to you. I wish I could tuck you in for the night-I miss that. We are managing very well with our food and I am feeling very well. I wonder if you have tried taking two pills a day. Be good to yourself!

Alfred I guess it is Friday-I was up at dawn-it was windy and rainy but I put on my wool pants-we had breakfast in the kitchen-then started for town to get my boxes-The wagon was in Espanola-Maria took it and went on to Santa Fe. I come home-driving the forty miles very slowly-the sun had come out-the country all so beautiful in the early light-every thing seems more fresh and alive and colorful than later in the summer when the hot sun burns up every thing possible-It was cool enough to have the heater on in the car-but oh I loved what I looked at along the way and I liked being alone-I was thinking to myself that [Art] may be having a very decadent period during [illegible] our time-but when a human being can take the pleasure that I take in the sun and the wind-the mesas and mountains-the dry areas and the river and the fresh spring

green of the cotton woods-oh-it seems some thing should come of it during a year when I feel as fine as I do this year-I am really feeling very well-never that half dead tired feeling-I got back to the house at noon-fixed my lunch-ate by myself in the kitchen then came in here and started to work in doors-it is too windy to try to work out. You speak of not having a letter one day-I have written every day but no mail goes on Sunday-I had your letter on the way to town this morning-in seperate [sic] envelope I am sending you a letter from Mrs. Fessler and one from Booth Parkington that you must return to her with the envelope clipped to it-I thought you would like to read both. A quiet kiss to you my little friend-if I sent it out with the wind that is blowing it would hit you hard-it is very windy-

Oh the wind is blowing hard this afternoon-clouds of dust out on the highway a mile away-It just isn't
warm out either-Ive [sic] been lying in the sun of the corner room where I can see all around in two directions-the graded earth at the sides of the road out there makes one see how this earth shouldn't be plowed for what the wind can do with it. I came into the little room here for Maria to dig a splinter out of my thumb-It has been there for days hurting but I didn't bother to look at it. Feels better now that it is gone-it was in my writing thumb-yes it is alright now-thank you. I was out painting all morning-There is not much to write-When I was ready to come in for lunch I got out my shovel and dug some dandelions for salad-then picked enough of another weed that is good for boiled greens in the spring-The onions I planted in our garden

are up-also two rows of some sort of greens, I don't remember the name. I planted the first three rows that were planted and of course they came up first. I did not mail Mrs. Feslers letter to you yesterday. When I got out to the mail box I read it again to myself and thought Maria would like to see it so brought it back to the house. She is making a type written copy of it now and I will send it off to you this afternoon-I had no letter from you today-but the mail does that some times-It will come on Monday.

Dear Mr. Stieglitz-
Georgia is looking very fine.-rosey-cheeked, reeking heavily of Garlic. Today we splurged and ate
up 23 stamps worth of beefsteak. Georgia cooked it out the back door over the charcoal. I looked out the window at her squatting over the fire and there was such a grin on her face! A broad grin out there all alone. That's the good thing about her: she's good even when she's alone. Maybe that's when she's best!
Well-she misses you-She talks about you. My greeting to you. Maria

Wed. morning May 12-Good Morning!  No letter went yesterday-I went out early to work-that is-I was out in the arroyo with my tree by eight-it was a fine perfectly clear still morning-At 10:30 I came in and we got the gardeners wife, [Saberna], who cooks over at [Arthurs] and started for chimio-that is a presbyterian mission some ten miles beyond Espanola where there was to be a government demonstration of fruit and vegetable dehydration-It was a fair cloudless fresh da-hot sun-a lovely drive-the dehydration demonstration very simple-ten years from now we will undoubtedly think it very primitive and funny but it is a beginning and there must be beginnings with such things-From what they did it seemed to me that the dried vegetables taste better than the canned ones-it is a very simple thing to try so we will try it. 

[Page 2]

2/ After that we went to see some friends of Marias-they have a place where they have been living for a year-and out there one always has a great curiosity to see how people are able to cope with the country-it is such a struggle-They had a big ditch and fine garden started-roses blooming-a house all in order with painted cupboards-rugs-fine floors-every thing fixed up-every thing growing-you have no idea how we like this empty house and dry country when we return to it after seeing such things-After that we called on Paul for half an hour-they went by the dairy and each had a bottle of milk-it was getting late-Then went to see Marie Garland.-Her place is quite appaling [sic] to me and still wonderful-full of birds of all kinds-some 20 peacocks strutting about-on the

Saturday-afternoon-a little after 5-for you it is after 8-and I suppose you had the boys for supper-I am sitting at the mail box so that I will be sure to get off some of a line to you if the mail man comes. 
	It has been another windy day-I was up at 5:40 set the bread to rise and got breakfast and ate it-kneaded the bread down a second time and was off to my tree a few minutes after eight-I came in at one-bringing some greens for our supper. It was so cold this morning that I kept my jacket zipped up to the neck all morning-I can't really tell about my tree yet but I think I am liking it. After lunch I lay down-then one of the Mexican men that does odd jobs for me came and sat for half an hour visit-after he left I covered up just lay there-I didn't sleep but I was glad to just be still-am still tired-Maria is

	Yesterday you wrote about the pencils. Maria sent them to you-she has a whole lot of them-I will read her what you wish about them but you will probably be writing her-the wind as it has been flowing is very trying-when I got up this morning it was still but as soon as the sun came up the wind started-It wears one down-
	I guess I'm sleepy from getting up so early-I hope you take the two pills and ask Saqa for the red ones I left for you-It may help you to pick up a little-I hope so-
	Have you sent the photographs to the magazine? The ^ color reproduction of the cows head with little hills came-of course it lacks what makes the painting good but I suppose one must say it isn't too bad-yes-that's good. A kiss to you-my "?" doesn't work today or my hand either-

Dear Mr. Stieglitz- 
Georgia is started on what she believes will be her best summer in years-very full of life and excitement about her painting-IT' [illegible deletion] [sic] makes the house full of life and excitement. A good feeling. Mrs. Brunette tried to tell me about why it was she liked O'Keeffe. (We were standing on a cliff-edge looking out at the sunset. She had her apron wrapped about her arms to keep her warm and she tried very hard to express what it was she meant about Georgia.) "I don't know much about her," she 

[Page 2]

said-"I don't know her, but she is the most pure person I have ever known." She is a big native woman, this Mrs Brunette, very direct and short spoken-a little cynical, very solid. "Pure" was the only word she could hit on in her unemotional vocabulary-but I think it expressed her, and what other natives (like Bernie and Sarah) feel about this O'Keeffe come of a civilization they do not know and more often hate than love.

standing-looking at the river-with my long brown coat on-it was pretty cool-Well-I must get on to town if this is to go in the mail-I am on an old road we used before the new highway was built on the other side of the river-This road is much more pleasant if you don't have to hurry-I had a sort of forlorn little letter from you this morning-I read it out  here under the trees-about Pemberton being in to see you-are you taking your Vitamine [sic] C-it might help your gums-I cant [sic] believe you could not feel better if you wouldn't be so odd about such things. It is so warm and sunny-I wish you were here-The shade is still cool these days.

I sit on a hill side in the car-overlooking the river about a mile from Abiquiu-Came out to my tree and settled in to work at about ten. At 1:15 I was much surprised to hear thunder-I looked around-the sky was very dark-and I could see the mist of rain coming across the mesas on the other side of the river-I packed up quickly and got the car out on to the road just in time for the rain but I only got the fringe of it-most of it swept down the other side of the river. I sat in the car-eating my lunch and watching it-as I sit here a wagon goes by-two pretty lean horses pulling it-a man and wife [inserted above the line] on the seat [/inserted above the line]-a very little girl and little larger boy sitting on the bottom of the back-a saddled horse being led tied to the back of the wagon-and a very small-very young colt trotting along beside-also an odd little black cur dog with a white tip on the end of his tail-Their spring planting is finished so they go to town probably-town being Abiquiu with its one store-all very fine-

When I came out this morning it was windstill [sic] and sunny.

I haven't had a letter from you in two days-tomorrow, Sunday, will be no mail-I hope you are alright-It is 8 oclock [sic]-almost time for you to be going to 59 for the night-Two men have gone on horse back-going to town for Saturday afternoon-much of America doing that I guess. Well-I hope you are alright-I worked and got up at six this morning-feeling very fine and ready to get up-I took a bath-a few exercises and made my room neat before breakfast. I hope you are all right-that the mail is just slow-A quiet kiss to you-

Tuesday-I think the 25th-. My watch stopped last night-I forgot to wind it-so I am vague about both the hour and the day-Im [sic] staying in doors today and I like being in-looking out-It is a sparkling day and the wind blows hard-I just couldn't take it. Your letters that came to me yesterday were mailed a week before-I think that just a plain old 3 cent stamp probably goes faster than the air mail often these days. About all I've done today was to dust my floors in my bedroom and workroom-lie in the sun and read the Sunday Times of May 16-thinking another one would come tomorrow and I had better read this one. It is a fine feeling to be indoors and not have the weather wearing me down-On my way home yesterday I passed a truck standing

I haven't opened it yet-Louisa [Garpfert] gave me points for it-It is very fine to have a whole new cheese in the ice box-After much struggle and long talking Maria has rented some land to plant beans. Well-we will see-I don't think there is much of a farmer in her-I don't expect any beans to develop from her venture-I do not say it to her-it is just my thinking and I hope I'm wrong-I think they will be about her 

[Page 2]

third or fourth interest and I doubt if one can raise very many beans unless it is at least ones second interest-Her way of going about it quite bores me-However-maybe Im [sic] wrong. Ill [sic] get back to what Im [sic] doing-my second white flower-I walked out into the red hills this morning ^ [inserted above line] before breakfast [/inserted above line]-found two of my flowers on top of a hill-squatted by them in the sun for a while-they are so very white and fragile-came in with out [sic] picking them-thinking in my head it is better-They look different if one brings them indoors-and they wilt quickly. Yes-25 years seems a long time when one speaks of it-but oddly it doesn't seem so long to me-A quiet kiss to you-and pat on your cheek-

Good afternoon. How are you-Here it is sparkling blue with a whistling wind-not bad - just the wind-It isn't the kind that makes the earth rise up-Yesterday Maria went to town at noon-I had a fine quiet day-working-ate my supper and went to bed early-and to sleep-slept very soundly-didn't hear her come home-at 2 A.M. she says. It is always an event for me when I sleep like that-The world sounds and smells and feels very good to me at that moment-I sat here with my hands over my eyes thinking what to say to you and that seems to be all there is to say-The sun and the wind-and a bird whistling some where out there in the big out doors [sic] all send you a greeting-.

A drive to town in the early morning-returning so that one arrives home when it is still good day light is all very good but a day of errands in town isn't any fun-one dentist that I went to had the whole waiting room full of Japanese from the concentration camp near Santa Fe-all in workmans [sic] clothes they were a very strong sturdy looking lot of men-middle aged or past that-One had a long soft grey beard-The dentist I went to was across the hall-I could see them from the

I had your letter in the mail box when I returned-it made me feel very lonely-then this morning another one and the envelope with the babys breath [sic]-so sweet-thank you-On the way home last night we drove down to the river at a place where it is only a very little way from the highway-got out of the car and walked a little along the river in a place where it was all open-no trees-but there was a very long cool shadow from big trees some [illegible deletion] distance away-I am painting and I am dull-A kiss to you-

I can see you wandering about going over your past-sort of ghost s for you every where [sic]-but I do think you could feel better if you would try-And if your food isn't right please tell [Saga]-

Tuesday afternoon-July 20. Good afternoon! Things have gone better for me today-I was up with the dawn and out to my cliff painting-I will not paint much more on it-It is an upright 16 x 30-a section of the cliff where there would be a water fall if it were raining hard-I wonder-could one speak of a dry water fall-It is in the morning and evening shadow that I've painted it because there seem to be more shapes-forms-in it at that time-In full sun it is quite flat-I think when I am through with this I will do it again-Oh every thing [sic] must be done again-My big bone over the mountain that I've been working on since I came in this morning is going very well-It looks so fine on my white wall-I've had a pretty good day-Have done all I can on it for today-and it pleases me-It isnt [sic] really a bone-it is some thing [sic] said that I can not [sic] say any other way and is a rather surprising thought-Maria would say that I speak as if I think I'm good--When ever [sic] I show her a new painting

she usually says "Oh-that is why I stay with you-because you can do that"-It is thundering-the sun shining-storms have rolled all around near by for days-It makes the sky exciting at times-particularly when there are long fringes or streamers of rain in the distance. Mike brought me the mail this morning-two letters from you-I was very glad to have them-Oddly this morning after I read them looked out toward the mountain and felt very fortunate to be knowing you as an old man and having daily words and thoughts from you-fortunate that I feel so close even tho [sic] I am so far away-I also had a letter from Borsig that was nice to have-I wonder if you will be going to the lake tomorrow or Thursday-I think the change for you will be good.

I am also keeping the two kittens I like best-but it seems funny to think of getting 30 dollars for the kittens-The people wanting them had seen the mother and father-both were very handsome-There is just nothing much to write-my latest painting is small-and I think will be alright-Maria has the last two in her room and loves them-

I think this is being one of my good years-I am wondering which of the two Red Oak Leaves was sent to Phillips-Was it the smoother lined one that I think is varnished or the one with the very red line down the center-Well-which ever-I do not want to be paid till the new year in case it is bought. Maria has come so I must go-I hope you are quite alright by now. A kiss to you.

[07-28-1943]

This morning I have been hating all people. But now I am over that. As you have been talking I have remembered an old resolution of mine-namely that when i [sic] have a child Noel will have a Foal. This may not happen sooner than in five years-i [sic] do not know. 
But as you talked i [sic] thought you might know a horse that should sire that Foal and i [sic] wanted to ask you-But i [sic] could not interrupt. So I write you this letter. 
Thank you for being Alfred!

Alfred I have missed the mail and I am pretty sad about it-Friday-July 30. For two days now no letter has gone to you-Yesterday afternoon I went to sleep after lunch much to my surprise and when I got up had to write the Bank about my income tax-also to Bobs secretary-and by the time I had fiddled with that I went out to the mail box to write to you and the mail had gone. I was very sorry-and my letters about my tax will not get off till today either but it really can wait as I have started in plenty of time. Day before yesterday I had to go off bright and early to see Francis [sic] parents. We had left her at the hospital to be operated on the day before as the doctor thought it necessary. We spent the day getting her in on relief-Then when I went over and told her parents they didn't want her to be operated on so I had to tear down to Espanola and telephone the

I plan to see Rich there.

7 P.M. for me-8 P.M. for you. Ive [sic] had my supper and will sit here a little while before I got to bed. It was raining in Chicago-I took taxi to the Art Institute-I was early-Rich not in -only galleries near the door open. The guard took my suit cases and put them in the check room-The check room girl had not come. Then he announced to me that my painting was in the room of new acquisitions-the first room to the right. He turned on the light and there I was by the window-very good light-and I liked myself-

[Page 2]

2-I thought the painting looked very handsome. I am glad it is there-you would be pleased if you could see it-and I would kiss you because it is beautiful. I looked about at some of that irredescent [sic] glass-Egyptian and Syrian I believe-a room of greek vases with a few statues-Then started back to the front door and met Rich coming in-We had a very pleasant time-Went down to the lunch room and had breakfast. I told him about sending the things to Philadelphia-We talked about what museums should do-I as a worker being

3/ interested in the evolution of Artists-he as a director thinking Museums should only have the very best things that a worker produces-Well I almost agree with his idea but as a worker-as a student I would have liked to find the development of two or three people lined up to look at-He thinks they would like to have a DeMuth [sic] showing in a year or two-and he wishes to see the oils-But that can wait-it is a long way off-They have a show by the Mexican, Posada-it is interesting-we walked through that. It was in the rooms

The Posadas are almost entirely black and white.-We looked at a few modern things around the central gallery up stairs [sic]-They look well-There is a Kandinsky that looked very beautiful. Yours I think will look better when it can be seen from a greater distance-The time went very fast-and I enjoyed it-

5. When I got on the train I ate my lunch then got into bed and stayed there all afternoon. I got up at six to go get this paper. Feel quite rested and fine. The outdoors looks grey and wet-water standing every where [sic] it can on level ground-the green of spring very vague-very young. I hope all goes well with you. I have thought of you so very often-Can still see you standing there as I drove away-no tear till I was in the taxi-I love you very much. I watched you waving till the taxi

04/20 Thursday A.M.
Alfred-I am sitting in my bed in a nice warm room looking out at the cliffs. The room is heated with a very small stove that we put up as soon as we arrived-having  no oil for the oil heater-that will come tomorrow-but this is fine and warm and dry. The sun shone on the bed every day so it was reasonably warm and dry-we brought blankets and sheets and pillows in here first thing so they would dry out thoroughly for the night in this room that can be made very hot-then we both slept here because it is the only room with a stove and the other rooms very cold-Today a stove burning all day in Marias [sic] room will fix her in her own place. It was almost sun set [sic] when we arrived so there was a great deal to do in a short while-We went to bed early after very good supper and I had a fine night. Johnnie in sailor suit-home on 5 day furlough met me at the train much to my astonishment-drove me up to Santa Fe-I had intended to go by bus-. Maria was finishing her shopping and loading and we soon got off in the open car 

[Page 2]

2-It was a fine drive in the sun-luckily very little wind. At Espanola I saw Orvill-he had been up here day before-connected water and charged up the electricity-He was out working in his garden-. Then we started for Abiquiu-Maria driving the wagon-I the roadster. I had put the top up as it was cool with the late afternoon. It seems odd to get into a car and start driving-the last 40 miles of the road up here-Odd the way it has become just a mechanical sort of action that one does without thinking-I stopped in Abiquiu to get Francis-and see Mr. Bode and get the mail-two letters from you very pleasant to see-
They say that they had a very hard winter-even yesterday morning every thing [sic] had been white with snow-With the wet earth and vague low sun it looked a little grey when we drove in-grey and cold-much snow on the mountain-but I was delighted to get here just the same. Every thing [sic] is in very good shape-some rooms have almost no dust at all-It will take a week or so of cleaning and putting things in order but it was left in very good order so it will not be much to do. Francis is here-seeming much more grown up 

[Page 3]

3/ The woman she worked for in Santa Fe offered her more money to stay-more than I pay her too-but she came up to me any way [sic]-It is very good to have her back-much easier than starting in with a new girl-So for the present-the household settles down as last year-and that is a comfort. We had breakfast as usual-chilly [sic] and garlic with chees [sic] and coffe [sic] and some toast and honey-I will get up now and look round again-I've been all round early but I'll go out again-Ill [sic] be quiet for a few days-the altitude makes me quickly feel out of breath but that will pass in a few days-particularly if I go slow in the beginning-I feel very well-Maria is fine and sends her love-She is very busy all over the place-Be good to yourself for me-And love me even if I'm far away-I'll be thinking much of you-. 
A morning kiss-.

And I am wondering how you are. I lay in my bed a long time early this morning looking out toward the cliffs-a grey sky--thinking of you-When I first looked out it was sleeting a fine sparse sleet from the West-I said to myself-Well-I wanted to be here early and I have certainly succeeded-The season is very late-They say they have had a very hard winter and it doesn't seem to let go even when it is time-Yesterday afternoon Maria and Francis went to a wedding-I wanted to go but it seemed foolish with my neck-(it is feeling very good)-and the cold-they dance in a great hall with no heat-the people come lighting their way with lanterns-They were a couple that I know quite

well-the girl and her mother plastered for me-the mother is one of the native people that I am particularly fond of-she was very pleased about the daughters [sic] marriage but was sad that her son was not there to dance at the wedding . The son is in India-She was also sad that Maria and I could not spend the night with her and talk all night so she would not think-I wish you could see her. She is so beautiful-I went to bed when it was dark last evening-had a hot bath then under the covers-Maria came home at about 11-I got up and drank tea with her to hear about the wedding.-Am cleaning up my big room today-It is better to start well cleaned up before I have things around-Francis came home from the wedding

on the 9 A.M. bus this morning. She walked in and brought me your two letters-one written the night after I came away when you found my notes-the other the next night. Both so good to have as I can see you so vividly from what you write. All day it has snowed off and on-never enough to make the ground white-it is too warm I suppose. There hasn't been any real sun shine [sic] in the two days I am here. It doesn't matter. We have been busy settling into the house and I dont [sic] walk much till I've been here for a week or so-A quiet kiss to you-I hope this finds you well-you were good about your feet-I wish you would do it twice a week-it is really important for you-Be very good to you.

	I have a new red tweed suit that I am wearing-it would have looked funny in N.Y. but here it is lovely. I like to look down and see the material-it is very good soft tweed-red-with green-yellow-and black spots-but mostly red. I didn't show it to you because I knew it would look very funny to you 
2
in N.Y. Here it seems to disappear into the country-and as I write a very red, or and and earth green zig zag patterned indian rug on the floor-a rough that is a sort of flame-makes my suit very pale-But my suit is so soft and warm I wish now that you could see it as it is here-I believe it is the only garment I ever bought that I didn't really need-just because I liked it-
	Yesterday Maria put away 15 dozen eggs in water glass for the times later when we can not get any eggs at all-
	I have all my cloths in bureau drawers and on the shelves in order-suit cases put away-so now I feel I'm really here-
	A morning kiss to you-I must get my canvas and go out-It is a fine day-and there is less snow on the  mountain-I think of you so often-

Thursday morning-A sunny day but the wind is blowing-a dust storm haze-Yesterday was very fine-I was out with my tree-it was a very fine morning-the sun hot and fine-after lunch I sunned my neck for a long time. It is very much better in spite of my standing out working-bare headed with my back to the wind for hours-and driving in the spare car-I am a little sun burned-always makes one look so much healthier that it makes me feel good too-Whether the sun does one any good or not I do not know-I have a suspicion that looking better makes us all feel better-. Late in the afternoon yesterday we went to Abiquiu to get the Laundry-it was a pleasant ride-the laundry lady looked very well-her house is so sweet and clean-there are many things around her to paint-but it is too hard to get to. We climb a very steep hill and cary [sic] the laundry 

[Page 2]

rather than drive the car up the very narrow steep road-It was good to see some one [sic] looking well when almost every one [sic] looks bad after the hard winter. We went to bed after listening to the nine oclock [sic] news-Maria is reading me that old Chinese essay on painting-I read it to myself last year-It is good to read again. Maria says he reads it every year-At any rate-Maria says he told her that he does. I had your letter enclosing the Newhall letter as we drove out the gate on the way to Abiquiu. Will read the Newhall ^ [inserted above line] tonight [/inserted above line] and return it to you tomorrow. I will be working indoors today-it is too windy to go out-My new cat is very delicate and perfect to look at-I say new because it is a cat now-last fall it was a kitten-I believe she is the most perfect one I've had-but very nervous-I hope you do not have trouble with your tooth-and to take care of your feet-and wash them twice a week-With the spring it is important 

[Page 3]

I think of you so often with such a feeling of worry and ache that it isn't funny-but I know there is so little I can do for you except be beside you-It is difficult.
A quiet kiss to you as you awake and as you go to sleep-.

Saturday afternoon. I've been out painting-finally-The sun was shining a little-only a very little so I went out. The wind was blowing too but I thought I could take it-I was out for three hours. It snowed and rained-and every thing [sic] else but I stayed by my tree-it was just about as cold as I like to be but I know that when it gets warm my tree will be green so I stayed there-and liked it. Then came in and worked on it in the house all afternoon-It looks gentle and soft and grey. And you-Young Man-have been under the covers for a day-Why dont [sic] you tell me instead of letting some one [sic] else tell me. I am glad you only had to stay home a couple of days-When you wrote of so many people and things I was worried-you sounded tired-I am sitting at the mail box-The car tight shut to keep warm-the sun hot on my face.
Bus coming-

Friday. Little Mister-It is a wicked day-cold and windy-warmer and sunny-cold again-every old thing-I've been very busy with my canvases all morning-dont [sic] think I sat down at all. Well-I haven't many things to sit on but wouldn't sit more if I had-I go out and lie on the bed in my corner room and look out the window rather than sit-but I didn't do that till after lunch and then only for a few moments-There was a letter from you yesterday-your Sunday letter-and a very nice one from Rich. Mike sent me a clipping-Rich has been made president of the National Association of Art Museum Directors-That seems to me good as I think he does not loose [sic] his head with the fast changes of the times-

[Page 2]

There is so little to write-I go to bed early-wake and read a little in the early morning hours-then sleep again and get up early. Maria says she thinks you know she is working for you-It was sweet the way she said it-at the table. We eat in the kitchen-the three of us by the window looking out toward the Red Hills-We have a red table cloth-The book from Dave that you sent me came yesterday-Thank you for sending it on-I've had time to look at a few books that I never had time for in N.Y. except when I did it evenings instead of talking with people-Oh-I like being here-even if the weather is so mad-A kiss to you-and how are you-I hope alright-I wonder about your tooth-and don't get too tired-

Tuesday A.M.-When I waked it was raining-as I brushed my teeth the bath room lighted with sun-I looked up and it was blue through the skylight in the cieling [sic]-out side [sic] windows in all directions were clouds and rain-But now a few hours later the sky is brilliant blue-a few white clouds and a hard-hard cold wind.-I knew I wouldn't go out so I read the N.Y. Times Sunday News section-9 days old-before I got up-It is beautiful out but I am content to stay in-Yesterday on the way to Abiquiu I received enclosed two letters-return them to me please. I am glad Mrs. Fesler is pleased as she seems to be-also Ludington seems satisfied. I will write him that you will quote price to him-You know the tree he means-The one that hung by the door going into the

I would like him to have its yellowness along with the two cooler paintings that he has-If he would pay me a little down on it now he could pay the rest when convenient-even if it runs over into next year-and take the painting now-If you dont [sic] want to bother to write him-tell me and I will write if you think above is alright-I would ask for four or five hundred down now-the rest when convenient ^ [inserted above line] some time before June-45. [/inserted above line]-It is funny-I am painting on that same tree with its dead winter look now-We had a fine trip to town yesterday-got our geraniums that Flora kept for us through the winter-they are all in very gay flower-also saw the 6 months old Body baby-it is a beautiful baby-

A wild windy clear day greets you-

Sunday night-There is half of a moon with a star near it high in the sky-I sit by an open fire-in Marias [sic] room-my back to it-It is very fine-the liveness of the open fire-Yesterday the bus came as I was writing to you-and maybe my last words were blotted-This morning I waked thinking of you-wondering how you are-and if Ira is taking good care of you-I got up-had breakfast in the kitchen and went out to my tree-big clouds-some white-some grey-my bare tree such soft greys-it is cold and windy-but I like it 

[Page 2]

2-After lunch I lay in the sun and went to sleep-got up and worked on my tree indoors-At six took a walk-Maria and the cat went along-walked up to the foot of my Dry Waterfall painting-It looked very beautiful to me-yes very beautiful-As I walk toward it the hills and trees in front of it are always changing-I will be working on it again later-Francis went dancing to Abiquiu with some of her friends-Maria and I had supper alone-

[Page 3]

Monday afternoon-Lying on my bed facing the cliffs-big lumpy clouds-fill the very blue sky-the sun is bright-I was out all morning with my tree again. My face is hot from wind and sun-The morning was mostly quiet-Wind didn't start till nearly 12. It often seems difficult for me to realize that I am here again and that I spent those months in the city-Every thing [sic] goes on so much the same as last year-It was so cold when I returned-the mountain a black wintry blue with quite a bit of snow on it seemed to float formidably in the distance-now that it is a little warmer it seems nearer and more friendly-

[Page 4]

We go to Abiquiu this afternoon for errands. I do not have to go but I will because I like the drive and seeing the people and the country-I hope your Sunday was alright-Oh I hope [underlined] you [/underlined] are alright. No mail here on Sunday-We will get it as we go out the gate-There is no news-the routine of the day goes along smoothly-Francis told Maria that no matter where she is-at home in [illegible]-in Santa Fe-or Abiquiu, she always thinks of coming back here-It is odd that she likes it-it is so quiet-she is a quiet little girl too-really nice to have about-A kiss to you-We will go onto [sic] the village. I wish I could watch you read this

Wednesday afternoon. I was out with my tree this morning till it was too cold and windy and snowing-But my tree gets on any way. I was up at 6:15-it was bright and clear-The snow came later. Maria and Francis went to town yesterday. They will be back tonight-I enjoy the time alone. It is as if the world is more mine when I am alone with it. I'd better hurry out with this as I am late. I wrote to Ludington but said nothing about price. I thought you would rather it be that way-A kiss to you 
It is very still now.

Thursday afternoon�It has been a beautiful day sunny�warmer with very little wind. I had a very comfortable morning out with my tree�almost the only comfortable time I�ve had out there. Before I came in I walked down in the bottom of the arroyo and picked enough dandelion greens for our salad for tomorrow�I suppose if one waits spring will come in time�There is a faint tinge of green on the bare trees where they are very sheltered�Lunch was late as I was late coming in�after that I washed my head�I sit here drying it now�the sun is so warm behind this window that I had to draw the curtain�Last evening after I mailed my letter I walked out toward the cliffs then off into the Red Hills�It was pleasant�always looking at things I think of painting or have painted and intend to try again� .

Also looking for wood for the kitchen stove�It was a good walk�When I came in I fixed my supper and ate it�fed the cat�then took a bath and got into bed�I intended to read but must have gone to sleep�a car waked me�it was Maria returning�I got up and had some tea with her by the fire�and heard the [illegible deletion] news. She had gone to town to see some Hindoos dance�she had a fine time�thought I should have gone too but I had a better time staying home by myself�Francis met a friend who was marrying a soldier and had to be bridesmaid�said it would be ignoble of her not to so she went off to get an evening dress for the wedding�it will be a dress with a train and will cost 3 weeks of her salary�so she will not return till Sunday�Well�it is a big event in her life�and so things go on�A fine day greets you and my love to you�
