She left to design sportswear for Sandeze, another California clothing house. She designed there for three years. Mary Ann then spent twelve years as head designer for Catalina, where she received world-wide acclaim as a designer. ^http://vintagefashionguild.org ^She worked with top studio designers on suits for the stars and for many years designed the swimsuits worn in the Miss America pageant. She also worked with Schiaparelli. Mary Ann was credited with such innovations as texture use, including Jacquard knits and appliquéd stretch cottons. She also introduced “sweetheart” matching swimwear and sportswear for men and women. ^ ^Having reached peaked success with Catalina she decided to launch her own company in 1951, called “DeWeese Designs,” turning out high-fashion swimsuits and sundresses. Her early swimsuits were often decorated with fanciful appliques and rhinestones. In 1961 she designed the official U.S. team suits for the World Water Team Championships and the Olympics in 1960. ^ ^The DeWeese Design label lasted until at least 1984."	"1801"	"Top and Jacket"		"1802"	"Skirt"		"1803"	"Skirt"		"1804"	"Jacket"	"LaFonde French workwear company, not to be confused with older ""LaFont"" workwear company, who sued LaFont for copyright infringement.

The relationship of this series to Rodin's watercolors of similar subject, which O'Keeffe first saw in 1908 in an exhibition at 291 and again in reproduction in Camera Work 34-35 (April - July 1911), has been frequently noted in the literature. That the works might be self-portraits has been suggested by Sarah Whitaker Peters in Becoming O'Keeffe (1991) pp. 109-12, nn. 97, 99, p. 327, Barbara Rose further qualifies this idea by indicating that the nudes ""are probably self-portraits in a mirror"" (O'Keeffe's Originality,"" in Georgia O'Keeffe Museum [1997], p. 102.

I hope it is my last door. You can call the light picture My Last Door....As I painted that light picture up here it was fine. When I got it into the studio in Abiquiu I would have given it another coat of white.- In your place I think it will be alright - but I want to paint the white whiter -Don't varnish or spray either of them. They are too fresh. Should wait a year or two"" (O'Keeffe to EH, 18 September 1952, AAA) Titled My Last Door by O'Keeffe on AN photograph."	"920"	"Untitled (Abstraction)"	"Remarks: Source of title image.
