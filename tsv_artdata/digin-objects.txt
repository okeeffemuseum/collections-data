The Hopi term for the carved wooden figures that represent the Katsinam is Katsina tihu (tithu, plural). Georgia O’Keeffe created paintings of Hopi katsina dolls (tithu) between 1931 and 1942. These religious figures were highly visible and available to non-Hopi and non-Pueblo people during this time, but the museum has no record regarding why she painted or drew these figures nor where she saw them. ^ ^ The back of a kachina figurine is depicted on the left side of the paper.  The figure's body is stocky and cylindrical.  Thin horns protrude from the head, and feathers hang from the horns.  The figure appears to be wearing a necklace.
