It presents a visual feast of 54 depictions of the calla by 33 different artists, such as Imogen Cunningham, Charles Demuth, Marsden Hartley. Rebecca James, Georgia O'Keeffe, Joseph Stella, and Edward Weston. its nine paintings of this elegant bloom by O'Keeffe, six by Hartley, and one by Demuth acknowledge the importance of this subject to the Stieglitz circle of modernist artists. Those by O'Keeffe, who became known as ""The Lady of the Lily"" in the 1920s because of the frequency and compelling ways in which she depicted the flower, define her achievement with respect to this subject and within the context of that of other American artists."

He traveled to New Mexico with the hope that painting directly from nature would purify him and his work, allowing him to develop an original, uniquely American style. Instead his work evolved into a complex meditation on distance, loss, and the aftermath of World War I. As Hartley moved farther from New Mexico itself, his paintings of the place became more personal, more melancholy, and more desolate. This exhibition examines Marsden Hartley's search fro a new modern American art in new Mexico, repositioning the period a an important part of his career, and bringing together many of the New Mexico paintings and pastels for the first time."

The works date from the 1920s forward, and most significantly, they reveal the artists' ongoing deep attraction to and profound appreciation of the natural world. They take as their subjects the myriad of sizes, shapes, and texures of elements O'Keeffe and Adams found in their environments, from tiny flowers to the awesome vastness of wilderness areas. ^ ^Anne Hammond, Honorary Scholar at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum's Research Center in 2001 and a specialist on Adams, selected the works included in this exhibition.

At the same time, it will bring the work of Australia’s two leading modernists to the United States for the first time, allowing American audiences to better understand the international scale of modernism and discover a rich artistic history that builds upon the more widely known narrative of American modernism. This presents a unique opportunity to advance both the scholarship and the public understanding of how modern art arose and developed in the 20th century across the globe."

Between 1936 and 1949, she returned to the remote site many times to create more than a dozen major works, primarily abstract compositions. In 2017, the artist Michael Namingha visited the same location to create work defined by a spare contemporary aesthetic. The Georgia O’Keeffe Museum is proud to present their work in conversation in an installation that includes paintings and drawings by O’Keeffe as well as new photographically based work by Michael Namingha created in 2017/18. Traveling 150 miles west of her Ghost Ranch home, O’Keeffe’s painting expeditions required an overnight stay, camping equipment, water and food, in addition to her drawing and painting supplies. In 2017, Namingha made a day-trip to The Black Place for the first time. The multidisciplinary artist carried only one tool, a drone camera. He returned to his studio with digital photographs and video recordings, a resource that he has developed into individual works of art during the past year. His work, like most of O’Keeffe’s, is not descriptive of the site, but refined and edited digitally to form a wondrous and disorienting experience for viewers. Working on a computer, Namingha divides, moves, and pulls the images using commands such as “distort,”“skew,” or “perspective.” When he is satisfied with the shape of his photographic image, he adds geometric bands of color to the composition, to emphasize, highlight, and complicate the visual meaning. He begins with black, but often transforms the color after completing the composition. The colors reference the activities of hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting oil and gas from deep beneath the surface of the earth. Brilliant yellow denotes the series of markers that trace the underground pipeline. The hot pink comes from maps created by NASA and the University of Michigan from a study of satellite data that recorded a large concentration of methane over the Four Corners region. The satellite images translate gases into false color maps. They selected pink and red to mark the “hottest” areas. Namingha chose that pink to represent these findings and to bring awareness to what is currently happening in this region.  Namingha’s work formally invites the viewers to consider the relationship between the fragile beauty of the site and nearby and active extraction processes that threaten and change landscapes formed over time in the slow processes of natural accretion and erosion. O’Keeffe painted in the region through the 1940s, even ^after Uranium mining commenced in the area. Her radical abstractions of the strangely beautiful geology carry no signs of human presence or disruption. Created in different centuries but inspired by the same remote site, comparing Namingha’s artwork to O’Keeffe’s presents an opportunity to examine our evolving notions of art and the landscape of New Mexico."

During World War I many European artists, including Duchamp, left their homelands bound for New York, a metropolis thriving with industrial and technological advancement. Skyscrapers, telephones, and automobiles wee altering the course of daily life at a dizzying speed while equally significant changes were transforming the social arena, particularly in he realm of sexual politics. Sigmund Freud's and Havelock Ellis's theories of sexuality garnered widespread interest during these years, as did the subject of equality between the sexes and the struggle for woman suffrage. The lively debate between the artists associated with Stieglitz and Duchamp ensued against this backdrop of sweeping societal and cultural change. ^ ^As curator Debra Bricker Balken writes in the exhibition catalogue, the debates between the artists in the Stieglitz and Duchamp camps had far-reaching results. ""The impact, as history has revealed, was simultaneously subtle and trenchant, reshaping the formal languages and content of American art with the ironic result that it finally attained the originality and cultural singularity that Duchamp had found sorely missing."" ^ ^For more information about Duchamp and O'Keeffe see: ^O'Keeffe, Georgia.

Central to this was her relationship, beginning in 1917, with Alfred Stieglitz, who would photograph O’Keeffe more than three hundred times over the course of twenty years.  Indeed, O’Keeffe’s self-presentation—her taste for starkly contrasting black-and-white clothes and ease in front of the camera—can be ascribed in part to her experience as Alfred Stieglitz’s model. But Stieglitz, who married O’Keeffe in 1924, was not the only photographer who made her a frequent subject. As O’Keeffe began spending more time out west, she was joined at home and in her travels by photographer friends, including Ansel Adams and Todd Webb. The present selection of photographs from the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum’s collection capture their subject in more candid moments, in contrast to the familiar and clearly posed character of so many images of the artist. The video that plays alongside these still photographs is an excerpt from the 1948 short film Land of Enchantment: Southwest U.S.A., directed by Henwar Rodakiewicz. In this more-or-less unscripted documentary footage, O’Keeffe is seen in nature and in the studio, consciously crafting her image in even the most seemingly spontaneous of scenarios."

Westheimer, Sr., a life-long resident of Ardmore, Oklahoma.  The painting depicts one of O'Keeffe's favorite landscape configurations, the flint-topped mountains, Pedernal, which looms in the distance directly beyond the patio of her Ghost Ranch house.  O'Keeffe made more than 20 paintings of this subject, several of which are already part of our collection, such as the pastel, Pedernal, 1945, and the oil painting, Spring, 1948. ^ ^The exhibition includes these and other New Mexico landscapes from our collection  from the 1940s along with other works from private collections that have been placed on extended loan to the Museum. ^ ^Featured also is a selection of the works on paper (charcoal, pastel and watercolor) that will become part of our permanent collection as a result of the generous and extraordinary transfer of assets of approximately 1,000 works to the Museum from the Georgia O'keeffe Foundation. ^ ^Featured also are eight paintings that have come to us as gifts through the wonderful and thoughtful generosity of two donors who wish to remain anonymous. These works represent the only public or private collection of images of New Mexico by the following eight artists, who worked here at various points in a 20-year period beginning in 1912, when New Mexico, which had been a territory, attained statehood: George Wesley Bellows, Thomas Hart Benton, Stuart Davis, Marsden Hartley, Robert Henri, Edward Hopper, John Marin, and John Sloan.

This exhibition was co-organized by the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum and the High Museum of Art, curator, Kathleen Pyne, on view at the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum and travels to High Museum of Art and San Diego Museum of Art. ^ ^ ^In the first two decades of the twentieth century, a number of extraordinary women developed individual artistic voices through their affiliation with Alfred Stieglitz and his Photo-Secession society, headquartered at his little Galleries at 291 Fifth Avenue in New York. Before his discovery and promotion of the work of Georgia O'Keeffe, Stieglitz included a number of women in the Photo-Secession and exhibited the works of even more over the long span of his gallery activity. He singled out a few for special attention, however, foregrounding the work of the photographers and painters Gertrude Käsebier, Pamela Colman Smith, Anne Brigman, Georgia Englehard, and Katharine Nash Rhoades. Their creativity in defining the woman modernist through their lives and their individual photographs and paintings is an essential but overlooked chapter in the history of modernism in New York. from their examples, Stieglitz fashioned the idea of the woman artist's vision a pure, innocent, and even childlike, as he would eventually characterize O'Keeffe's art. ^ ^The paintings and photographs of the women artists selected fro this exhibition explore the changing themes of femininity in modernism. They begin with a traditional garden world of mothers and children in the work of Käsebier, and then abruptly change to the drama of the new woman's struggle for freedom in the nude studies of Brigman. In Smith's watercolors and Rhoades's paintings, the artists experiment with mystical and abstract landscapes that resonate with the unconscious mind. In the works of O'Keeffe, nature is offered as a paradise, in a manner similar to the child's vision of the world. ^ ^After O'Keeffe's arrival in New York in 1918, Stieglitz's investment in O'Keeffe's iconic stature made certain that these women were eclipsed by her presence. For as a woman alone among men, O'Keeffe as icon had he greatest power to represent his modernist ideology. Also featured in this exhibition are many of Stieglitz's photographs of O'Keeffe, as the iconic, woman modernist who revealed woman's essential nature as a woman-child. The stories of Käebier, Smith, Brigman, Engelhard, and Rhoades, as related in the exhibition, reveal their contribution to the feminine role in modernism, as O'Keeffe, would inhabit it."

Since he moved to Santa Fe eleven years ago and acquired his first New Mexico picture at a local art gallery, the owner of this collection has passionately pursued his love of American Modernism by collecting works that creatively engage the area's distinctive environments, landmarks, and residents. ^Some of the pictures in the exhibition clearly represent specific people sites (fig. 1), but others evoke New Mexico more abstractly, as in Stuart Davis's Interior, New Mexico (1923, fig. 3) and John Marin's Mountains (Sangre de Cristo), 1930 (fig. 2.). Shortly before his first trip to Taos in 1929, Marin wrote ""the true artist must perforce from time to time go to the elemental big forms -- Sky, Sea, Mountains, Plain ... to sort re-true himself up, to recharge the battery."" ^Still other works in the exhibition -- such as Georgia O'Keeffe's Black Place IV (1944, cover) -- approach particular forms and places with an abstracting vision so personal as to transform the subject into a vehicle of private expression and formal experimentation.
